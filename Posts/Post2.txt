My Gaming PC Build

<p>I've recently been slowly replacing the parts to my old PC with new ones, and eventually I'll end up with a whole new computer, case and all. I started out with the parts from my older brother's old build, which included a GTX 650, an Intel i5 3570k and a stock Intel cooler, the Z77-UD4H motherboard by gigabyte, the Corsair 400R case and various case fans, 8GB of RAM (1600 MHz), a 750W power supply, a 128 GB Kingston SSD, and a 500 GB HDD by WD. I had to buy a monitor, and a mouse, and I got an old membrane keyboard I found lying around my house.</p>

<p>I have since upgraded a lot of these parts, and I am in the process of getting all new parts for a build I intend to complete over the summer (2017). I've upgraded my graphics card twice, first going for the GTX 960 FTW for Christmas of 2015, and more recently I got the MSI Armor GTX 1070. This thing is an actual beast and I've been loving it so much. I also upgraded my monitor in 2016 on Black Friday, I bought a 29" LG ultrawide and I love having it. Just being able to multi-task and easily have 2 windows open is amazing. My one complaint about it is that it only runs HDMI, which is okay, but my GPU only has one HDMI slot which might be an issue when I purchase VR equipment. I've upgraded my storage capabilities significantly. I now have a 250GB Samsung 850evo, as well as the original 500GB HDD, and on top of that, my dad bought me a 2 TB Seagate Barricuda HDD. It all comes in handy with all the steam games I have installed. I got the Razer Black Widown Chroma for my birthday over the summer of 2016, which I think is an amazing keyboard and a HUGE upgrade from my old one. Lastly, I just upgraded my CPU cooler to the Phanteks PH-TC12DX, which has helped my overclock my CPU to a stable 4.4 GHz. I'll make another post about that process soon.</p>

<p>Other upgrades I plan on making until my final build is done is a new CPU (I'm looking at the i7 6700k or the i7 7700k but we'll see how Zen looks when it comes out), a new motherboard, new (and more) RAM, a new case, power supply, and case fans. The whole build is going to be a black and white theme, which I hope to have complete by mid summer 2017. Once it's all done I'll be buying an HTC Vive (or Vive 2??) and my hardware should definitely be sufficient for some VR gaming.</p>
