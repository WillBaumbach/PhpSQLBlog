First Post

Welcome to my website. My name is William Baumbach, but I usually just go by Will. I set up this website so I can play around with web design and development. I will be tracking what I am up to in the realm of computer science, as well as my other interests. If you're interested in computers, computer gaming, cool projects, weight lifting and fitness, or photography you might like it here. Thanks for stopping by!
