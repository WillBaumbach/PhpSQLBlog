<p>Hi Everyone!!</p>

<p> It's been so long since I wrote a post for my site, so I figured I would write one to make an update! Recently I've been really bogged down with school, work, the gym, and trying to fit in a little time to relax
	and do some things that I enjoy. For school I've been working on projects for a few of my classes, the most important one being for my computer orginization and architecture class. For that class I have to write 
	a program that will simulate MIPS assembly code, and we were given the options of java and C are the language. Unfortunately, I don't know any C so I opted to do the program in java, which has proven to be a little challenging. For starters, I don't understand the MIPS pipeline as well as I probably should, so a lot of the work has gone to teaching myself the ins and outs of the process so I feel more comfortable writing the program. Also, it seems like the project is better suited for C, but nevertheless I am making progress slowly but surely, and should have it done by the due date, which is April 23rd.</p>

<p> In the gym I am consistantly making progress, and I'm proud of myself for getting back into the rhythm of going 5-6/week. About a month ago I had to take 3 weeks off due to being sick, and it really set me back pretty 
	far, and made me feel pretty discouraged. However, I'm almost back up to my best numbers, and I expect to surpass them within the next few weeks! I feel as though I'm in a routine and it feels really nice to have that
	feeling. By the end of the summer I hope to hit a 315lb deadlift, a 250lb squat, a 185lb bench press, and a 115lb overhead press. If I continue to progress at the rate that I have been for the past few weeks, I should expect to exceed them before the end of August!</p>

<p> As for entertainment, as always since release, I've been playing overwatch every once in awhile (see: mostly on weekends). On top of that, I have been playing the game <i>Knights of Pen and Paper 2</i>, which is a 
	turn-based, pixel art adventure that uses a D&D like game to further the plot. I've been really enjoying it, and I picked it up in the Paradox sale on steam last week for the low low price of ~$3 for the deluxe edition (Normally priced at $15). I think I'm only getting started on the storyline, as the highest member of my team is only level 15, and there are achievements to get to level 40. For $3 I really cant complain, but so far (~3 hours in) I would buy the game full price at arounf $10, but I may be more stingy than most people. However, my opinions are subject to change, and I honestly expect them to if the game is as long as the achievements make it seem, as I get further into the game. </p>

<p> So what is happening in the future? Well, I finish up my junion year of college in a few weeks, and I will hopefully have an internship for over the summer. I have a few projects in mind for over the summer, including
	an SNES controller that functions as a retro game emulator, upgrading my current computer build with all new parts, some things regarding my website, some photography projects, as well as small raspberry pi projects sprinkled inbetween. This next week will be a stressful one, as I have 3 projects due, but I'm managing my time wisely, and I think everything will go smoothly. After that, just one more week of classes, and then finals week. </p>
