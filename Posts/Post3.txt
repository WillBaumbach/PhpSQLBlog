Updates on the Website

<p> I've made a few changes to the website, a few of which are visual, but most of which are all in the back-end of things. As you can see, there is a new CSS layout, with a side navigation bar (currently nonfunctional). Next up on visual things is to workout getting the date to display under the posts, as well as making the navigation bar functional. Also, I would eventually like to do some CSS stuff that fits different screen sizes better. On the back-end, I added a MySQL database to hold all of the blog posts. Before, I would add the posts directly into the html code (which I knew was a very temporary solution) but after some googling, I figured out how to incorporate a database in. To do so I had to switch from html to a php file, and write some scripts, most of which I learned how to do from google. </p>

<p>For future updates I hope to add an image gallery so I can post some of my pictures that I take on my camera, as well as a page to post information about my projects, which will be more formal than just regular blog posts. I mean that as in the page will have a description of the projects, as well as pictures, and maybe even download links, whereas a post will just contain updates and possibly pictures. </p>
