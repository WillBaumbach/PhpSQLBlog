# PhpSQLBlog
Another iteration of my blog site, this time using PHP and SQL to manage posts.

TO-DO:
- Look at bootstrap and try to implement columned layout
- Add projects page
  - Implement PHP to add posts from database?
- Add resume
- Add splash play screen to brick break

- Fix scrolling by making the sidebar always stationary.
    - FIXED: Changed the backgrounds so the navbar wouldn't get that "bouncing" effect on scrolling
