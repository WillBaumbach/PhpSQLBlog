#TODO:

- Format brick break page to include sidebar.
- Format brick break "warning" in a nicer way.

# Major things:

- Add a paging system for blog posts
  - I.e. selecting how many posts per page, and being able to select different pages.
- Add a sign in system
  - This would be a step in the right direction to add comments, as well as automating the posting process a little better.
- Finish implementation of projects and pictures pages.
